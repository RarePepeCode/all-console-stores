There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch.<br/><br/>Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found…<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming.<br/>- Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock.<br/>- Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome.<br/>- Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Uses DUALSHOCK 4 vibration function<br/>Remote Play allows users to connect to and play games on their PlayStation®4 or PlayStation®5 using a mobile device, PC, or another PlayStation®4 or PlayStation®5.<br/>Offline play enabled<br/><br><br>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Traveling with Cannon Lines, Molty will take on the most demanding and varied platforming challenges to reach Carrotland's furthest and oldest Mailboxes:  endless pits, giant boulders, steep slopes, bouncing platforms, sharp spikes..... tough roads! But when the power is out, you can't send an e-mail!  <br/><br/>Explore magical worlds, from the calm beaches of Coconut Islands to the freezing heights of Yeti Ridge, make new friends, race against unusual mech-rivals,  solve puzzles and find all of the delicious collectibles scattered around Carrotland, as Molty (the mail mole!) embarks on an adventure to make his most  important delivery yet... before it's too late!  <br/><br/>In Peaceful Plaza, Carrotland's main hub, you'll meet a happy bunch of villagers, which are currently worried because of a fishy power outage.  But worry not, as Molty will help to fix the power lines and receive some accessories as a reward!  An elegant top hat, a goofy straw hat, a lovely bunny headband or a flashy jetpack will make Molty look like the coolest mail mole around!  <br/><br/><br/>Features: <br/><br/>- Explore over 30 levels full of platforming challenges <br/>- Gather carrots and buy costumes for Molty at Rick's Store <br/>- Find all the collectibles scattered around Carrotland <br/>- Race against a bunch of evil mecha-moles in super fast time attacks <br/>- Introducing our new hero, Molty the Mail Mole!<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Uses DUALSHOCK 4 vibration function<br/><br><br>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

So get 1 yourself, add 1 partner, mix it well with flying food and a pinch of challenge powder, and there you have it – Let’s Cook Together, a bonding couch co-op experience for 2 players! <br/><br/>Throw, catch, talk!<br/>You and your partner – aspiring chefs – find yourselves in a quite impractical commercial kitchen. It’s divided by a long serving counter, yet the produce and the appliances you both need are placed on the opposite sides of the room. Your job is to cooperate, cook together and serve orders of steaming, delicious food. Chop, stir and fry everything you can while throwing (at) your partner all the ingredients they need. Prove that cooking is a piece of cake as long as you do it together!<br/><br/>Features<br/>- Everybody can have a taste. The game can be enjoyed by kids, teenagers, adults, and elders alike. Make cooking THE opportunity to forge new bonds and refine existing ones.<br/>- Use your noodle. To complete orders as efficiently as possible, rely on your planning and communication skills; reflex and agility are considered a side dish in this kitchen.<br/>- Fresh challenges everyday. Each level brings new ingredients, appliances and recipes to the table, raising the difficulty level bit-by-bit. <br/>- Different foods call for different measures. Earn stars to progress through the game. Unlock new restaurants, upgrade your cooking gear to meet ever-changing cooking standards, and gain access to new character skins. <br/>- Never overeat on fun.

Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.</b><br>Not every game can be rated solely by screenshots. It's like a human's essence that can’t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it’s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/><br><br>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.<br/><br/>《Main Features》<br/>■ Exploring with new field actions!<br/>Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.<br/>■ More action-filled real-time battles!<br/>Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.<br/>■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!<br/>Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with “Evolution Link” to create entirely new items.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>- Please visit the official website for more information on the listed content: https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/ryza2/<br/>- Sets that include the main game, such as “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Digital Deluxe Edition” and “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Ultimate Edition” are also currently on sale.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/><br><br>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.</b><br>This is not just another RTS, in which you are an invisible being hovering over the battlefield. In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes.<br/><br/>Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It’s a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy.<br/><br/>Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes.<br/><br/>Radio Commander includes:<br/>- 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways),<br/>- 9 animated briefings,<br/>- 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice),<br/>- full voice over,<br/>- over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages,<br/>- over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Offline play enabled<br/><br><br>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Outsmart, outmaneuver, overpower, outclass your opponents in lightning-fast, adrenaline-inducing single-player space combat.<br/><br/>You play as Leon Barret, ace fighter pilot of the Poseidon Security Forces.

Every ship movement, from rolling to avoid missiles to pushing the limits of your ship via the enhanced boost, will make you feel like you are actually driving a space-capable fighter jet, on the brink of control.
